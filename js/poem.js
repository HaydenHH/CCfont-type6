			Jade dew withers and wounds the groves of maple trees,\
			On Wu mountain, in Wu gorge, the air is dull and drear.\
			On the river surging waves rise to meet the sky,\
			Above the pass wind and cloud join the earth with darkness.\
			Chrysanthemum bushes open twice, weeping for their days,\
			A lonely boat, a single line, my heart is full of home.\
			Winter clothes everywhere are urgently cut and measured,\
			Baidicheng above, the evening's driven by beating on stones.\

					South of my hut, north of my hut, all is spring water,\
					A flock of gulls is all I see come each day.\
					The floral path has never been swept for a guest,\
					Today for the first time the rough gate opens for the gentleman.\
					Far from the market, my food has little taste,\
					My poor home can offer only stale and cloudy wine.\
					Consent to have a drink with my elderly neighbour,\
					At the fence I'll call him, then we'll finish it off."

					Swift wind, heaven high, an ape's cry of grief,\
					At the islet of clear white sand, birds circle round.\
					Endlessly, trees shed leaves, rustling, rustling down,\
					Without cease, the great river surges, surges on.\
					Ten thousand miles in sorrowful autumn, always someone's guest,\
					A hundred years full of sickness, I climb the terrace alone.\
					Suffering troubles, I bitterly regret my whitening temples,\
					Frustratingly I've had to abandon my cup of cloudy wine.\

				    　正如我轻轻的来；\

				    　沉淀着彩虹似的梦。\

				    　向青草更青处漫溯，\
				    满载一船星辉，\
				    　在星辉斑斓里放歌\
				    但我不能放歌，\

				    夏虫也为我沉默，\
				    　沉默是今晚的康桥！\

						As quietly as I came here;\
						Quietly I wave good-bye,\
						To the rosy clouds in the western sky.\
						The golden willows by the riverside,\
						Are young brides in the setting sun;\
						Their reflections on the shimmering waves,\
						Always linger in the depth of my heart.\
						The floating heart growing in the sludge,\
						Sways leisurely under the water;\
						In the gentle waves of Cambridge,\
						I would be a water plant!\
						That pool under the shade of elm trees,\
						Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky;\
						Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds,\
						Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream?\
						To seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream,\
						To where the green grass is more verdant;\
						Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight,\
						And sing aloud in the splendor of starlight.\
						But I cannot sing aloud,\
						Quietness is my farewell music;\
						Even summer insects heap silence for me,\
						Silent is Cambridge tonight!\
						Very quietly I take my leave,\
						As quietly as I came here;\
						Gently I flick my sleeves,\
						Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away."
